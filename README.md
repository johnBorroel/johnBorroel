<h1> Hi! My name is Jonathan Borroel </h1>

I am a recent graduate of UCI with a B.S. in Computer Science with a specialization in Information. I am passionate about creating software that is clean, maintainable and able to solve the task at hand efficiently and elegantly. I am constantly looking for ways to improve myself and I love working with teams that are knowledgeable, easy to work with, and willing to learn at all times.

<h2>What Am I Working On Now?</h2>
Currently I'm searching for full-time positions as a software engineer as well as projects to work on in my off-time. While I search for those, I've kept myself busy by taking online courses to learn new skills such as HTML/CSS, Javascript and Flask/Django as well as improving and reinforcing skills I've already learned such as SQL and JAVA. I also continue to update my discord bot with new suggestions from friends and any ideas I may come up with throughout the day.
